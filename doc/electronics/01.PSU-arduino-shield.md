Overview
===
I'm usingan AT PC 350W PSU, hopefully it will keep up required Amps without issues, the only issue might be 
possible voltage drops or waveform quality because PC PSUs are not known for their quality or efficiency.
Here's a collection of photos documenting current work.

From a stock PowerSupply I'm taking out this cable. From here I have taken out +12v, +5v, PS-ON, PG and GND wires.
3.3v and negative voltages are not needed in this project

The 4 Pin addon molex also supplies 2 12v additional lines, I have connected it as well to get more Amps later on
