#### small update
I'm currently focused on PCB creation because I strictly need fresh new PCBs for this project as well as for others, there might be a lot of activity on PCBen and something less here. I don't want to deal with transfer method or various chemicals anymore. Checkout https://github.com/andreabenini/PCBen, https://andreabenini.github.io/PCBen for updates
