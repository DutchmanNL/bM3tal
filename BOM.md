# Bill of materials
These are official materials I have planned to use, it will be the final construction list. Prices here are expressed in metric measurements and euros (still simple to translate for US Folks too)
- [Quimat 3D Printer Controller Kit for Arduino Mega 2560 Uno R3 Starter Kits +RAMPS 1.4 + 5pcs A4988 Stepper Motor Driver + LCD 12864 for Arduino Reprap](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B06XSZ9M77). This is a common RAMPS controller easily available everywhere, it's not the cheapest one but it's well known and respected for its reliability. Available from fareast (for less) and west retailers in various formats
- [3X Mechanical Endstop Module](https://www.amazon.com/XCSOURCE-Mechanical-Endstop-impresoras-TE250/dp/B012C4NNI2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1501158350&sr=8-1&keywords=TE250+endstop). These are quite cheap and I'll use them until I'll finish v1.0, on v2.0 I'll use home made optical endstops. BTW getting these parts already assembled it's better than build them from scratch, at least to complete the project
- #2 Square steel tube from local hardware store: 30x30x200(mm) ~17.00€
